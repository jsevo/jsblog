Hi, I'm Jonas. I'm scientist currently living in New York City. I moved here after having started a machine-learning based [ legal tech business ](mailto:jonas@claws.io) with three friends in London last year.

In 2014, I finished my PhD in Computational Biology at Oxford University, where I was supervised by [Kevin Foster](https://zoo-kfoster.zoo.ox.ac.uk/). After that, I moved to Japan on a JSPS fellowship to work with [Hisashi Ohstuki](http://bio-math10.biology.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuki/index_e.html) on game-theoretical models of evolution. I am now based at Memorial Sloan Kettering where I am working with [Joao Xavier](https://xavierlab.org/) on developing new machine learning approaches to analyze microbiota data from cancer patients.

My goal is to build better microbiome models so that we can understand how the microbes in our bodies influence us, and predict how to manipulate them to improve our well-being ([check out my research](http://jonas-schluter.com/#/academia)).
